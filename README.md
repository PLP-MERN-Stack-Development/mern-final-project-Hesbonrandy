# ☕ Monran Coffee House – MERN Capstone Project

Monran Coffee House is a full-stack web application that digitizes the café ordering experience. Customers can browse the coffee and food menu, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and view their order history. Admin users can manage menu items and monitor incoming orders—making it a complete solution for small cafés looking to streamline service.

Built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this project demonstrates modern full-stack development practices including JWT-based authentication, RESTful API design, responsive UI, testing, CI/CD, and cloud deployment.
